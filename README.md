> **Maturity:** Functional Prototype
> _Reliable webhook dispatcher with exponential backoff, retry queues, and HMAC signature validation._

## The Problem
## Problem Statement
Downstream third-party servers often fail, leading to silent data loss.

## Architecture & Solution
Instead of Redis, it uses an embedded SQLite-backed state machine to track delivery attempts, ensuring absolute delivery persistence. Simple CRUD applications fail when subjected to high throughput, race conditions, or massive data sets.

## The Solution
This project implements a robust microservice architecture designed to handle these specific edge cases. By utilizing advanced paradigms like idempotency keys, advisory locks, or optimized caching layers, this service guarantees data integrity under load.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core Technology**: Node.js, BullMQ, Redis
- **Architecture**: Microservices, Event-Driven

## Decision Log
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Monorepo vs Polyrepo | Chosen self-contained repository for easier deployment and PoC demonstration |
| State Management | All state is pushed to the Data Store/Cache to keep the API stateless and horizontally scalable |
| Error Handling | Standardized JSON error responses with explicit error codes |

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SumitDalavi/webhook-delivery-system.git
cd webhook-delivery-system

# 2. Build and start
docker-compose up -d --build

# 3. Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

The API is now available at **http://localhost:8080**

## 🧪 Usage & Demo

```bash
# Health Check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Simulate Traffic
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/trigger -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test":"payload"}'
```

## ✅ Verification

| Check | Command | Expected |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Health | `curl http://localhost:8080/health` | `{"status": "ok"}` |
| Load | `make test` | All unit/integration tests pass |

## Mock Boundaries (Honest Scope)

| What | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Task Broker | **Real** | Uses BullMQ over a real Redis instance for durable queuing. |
| Dispatcher Worker | **Real** | Executes HTTP calls with exponential backoff. |
| Receiver | **Simulated** | A local express endpoint acts as the webhook sink for tests. |

## 🚀 Progressive Credential Loading & Execution Tiers

This project implements **Progressive Credential Loading (PCL)**, allowing it to run immediately out-of-the-box without external dependencies while seamlessly upgrading as credentials are provided.

### Tier 1: Zero-Config Mock Mode (Default)
Ideal for CI, testing, and rapid local evaluation.
- **Execution:** Run with default configuration (`cp .env.example .env`). Zero API keys, databases, or cloud credentials required.
- **Fallback Behavior:** In-memory caches, deterministic offline heuristics, mock vector embeddings, and local mock storage are automatically used.
- **Health Verification:** Endpoints report `{"mode": "mock"}` for unconfigured dependencies.

### Tier 2: Local Development with Live Services
Connect specific external services while keeping others mocked.
- **Execution:** Provide credentials in `.env` for the services you want active (e.g., `DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
- **Progressive Upgrade:** The runtime inspects environment variables on boot and dynamically promotes only configured modules to live mode.
- **Safe Fallback:** Any missing credentials automatically remain on mock fallbacks with no crashes or missing service errors.

### Tier 3: Production Hardened
Enterprise deployment with production-grade backends, security scans, and container distributions.
- **OCI Container Image:** Pre-built, multi-arch image on GitHub Container Registry:
  ```bash
  docker pull ghcr.io/sumitdalavi/webhook-delivery-system:v0.2.0
  ```
- **Production Orchestration:** Mount secrets via Kubernetes Secrets or cloud secret managers with atomic config reload support.
- **Release Verification:** Checksums and SPDX SBOM available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SumitDalavi/webhook-delivery-system/releases).

## 📚 Documentation

- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — System diagram and component details
- [Runbook](docs/runbook.md) — Setup, commands, and expected outputs
- [Decisions](docs/decisions.md) — ADRs for message broker selection
- [Changelog](docs/changelog.md) — Change history

## Known Limitations
- **Persistence**: Worker boundaries and persistence are currently simulated in-memory.

## 🔒 Release & Security Verification

The project includes an automated DevSecOps release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggered on semantic version tags (`v*.*.*`).

Each release automatically:
1. Executes test suite gates.
2. Builds the container image.
3. Performs vulnerability scanning via Trivy.
4. Generates an SPDX SBOM (`sbom.spdx.json`) using Anchore Syft.
5. Publishes a GitHub Release with attached SBOM.

### Verifying the Release
```bash
# Verify release via GitHub CLI
gh release view v0.2.0 --repo SumitDalavi/webhook-delivery-system

# Download and inspect SBOM
gh release download v0.2.0 --repo SumitDalavi/webhook-delivery-system --pattern "sbom.spdx.json"
cat sbom.spdx.json | jq .
```
